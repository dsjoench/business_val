This portfolio,combining with a Excel-based portfolio, aim to build an algorithmic trading by analyzing investment portfolio and time series data to optimize overall return. Later I will post a video on each steps I did.

The codes shown in this respository built in python, along with some object oriented programming to automate time series analysis procedure.

1. Import data/ manupulate data so that users can flexibly adjust parameter such as stock index, data range to scope in financial data.
2. Data  visualization on moving average, standard deviation,etc
3. Highlight informative attributes to generate signals to forecast future stock price via various machine learning algorithms
4. Conduct financial analysis to turn financial statements into actions.
